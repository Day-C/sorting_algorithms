		sorting Algorithmes
		------------------

A sorting algorithm is a collection of instructions that can convert an unsorted input to a sorted output. simple right?
A sorting algorithm is used to us used to rearrange a given array of listof elements accordint to a comparison operation. The elements comparison is used to decide the new order of the elements in the respective sata structure.

		Big O Notation
		--------------
The Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiing behaviour of a function, when the algorithm approaches a particular value of infinity. It is used to describe the efficiency of the an algorithm in terms of input and size.

Time Complexity:
---------------
Time complexity referes to the ammount of tile an algorithm takes to complete as a function if the lenght of the input. The Big O Notation is used to get the Best, Midd and worst case time complexity of an algorithm.

Space Complexity:
----------------
Space complexity is the ammount of sapce an algorithm requires as a function of the lenght f the input. Here again the Big O Notaion is used to get the Best, midd, and worst case space complexities of an algorithm. 

Sorting Algorithms
================================

- Bubble sort:		- merge sort:		- counting sort:

- Insertion sort:	- Quick sort

- Selection sort:
